Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.'"

    "        - Token Deletion: Random tokens are deleted. The model must learn to predict the token content and find the position where the token was deleted from.\n",
    "        - Text Infilling: A fixed number of contiguous tokens are deleted and replaced with a single [MASK] token. The model must learn the content of the missing tokens and the number of tokens.\n",
    "        - Sentence Permutation: Sentences (separated by full stops) are permuted randomly. This helps the model to learn the logical entailment of sentences.\n",
    "        - Document Rotation: The document is rearranged to start with a random token. The content before the token is appended at the end of the document. This gives insights into how the document is typically arranged and how the beginning or ending of a document looks like.\n",
